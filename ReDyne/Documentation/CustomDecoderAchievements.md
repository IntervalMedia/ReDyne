## 🔥 The Bitmask Immediate Decoder

### The Challenge

ARM64's bitmask immediate encoding is **notoriously complex**:
- Encodes diverse patterns in just **13 bits** (N:immr:imms)
- Supports repeating patterns (e.g., 0x5555555555555555)
- Variable element sizes (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 bits)
- Rotation within elements
- Used in all logical immediate operations

### Our Solution

We implemented the **complete bitmask decoding algorithm** as specified in the ARM Architecture Reference Manual:

```c
/**
 * Decode ARM64 bitmask immediate encoding
 * 
 * This is one of the most complex parts of ARM64 encoding!
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Determine element size from N:NOT(imms)
 * 2. Extract rotation (r) and run length (s)
 * 3. Generate pattern of (s+1) consecutive ones
 * 4. Rotate pattern right by r positions
 * 5. Replicate across register width (32 or 64 bits)
 */
static bool decode_bitmask_immediate(
    uint8_t n, 
    uint8_t immr, 
    uint8_t imms, 
    bool is_64, 
    uint64_t *out_value
);
```

### Real-World Impact

**Before (Naive):**
```assembly
and x0, x1, #0x1837    ; Raw encoding - meaningless!
```

**After (Enterprise-Level):**
```assembly
and x0, x1, #0xFF      ; Actual value - immediately understandable!
```

### Supported Patterns

Our decoder correctly handles:
- ✅ Simple masks (0xFF, 0xFFFF, etc.)
- ✅ Alternating patterns (0x5555555555555555)
- ✅ Repeating bytes (0x00FF00FF00FF00FF)
- ✅ Power-of-2 boundaries (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0)
- ✅ Complex rotations (0xFFFFFFFF00000000)
- ✅ All valid element sizes (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 bits)

## 🚀 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Byte Masking
```assembly
and x0, x1, #0xFF
; Our decoder: Correctly shows #0xFF
; Naive approach: Would show #0x007 (raw encoding)
```

### Example 2: Alignment Check
```assembly
and x0, x1, #0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0
; Our decoder: Shows actual 16-byte alignment mask
; Naive approach: Would show gibberish
```

### Example 3: Bit Toggling
```assembly
eor x0, x0, #0xFFFFFFFF00000000
; Our decoder: Shows upper-32-bit toggle mask
; Naive approach: Incomprehensible
```

### Example 4: Alternating Pattern
```assembly
